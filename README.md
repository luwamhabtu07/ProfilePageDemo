# My Profile Page App

This is a simple Expo React Native application that demonstrates the use of core components:
- **View**
- **Text**
- **Image**
- **ScrollView**
- **TextInput**

## Project Overview

The app is designed to showcase a user profile page. It includes:
- A header section with a title.
- An image display area using an online image.
- A ScrollView populated with several text elements.
- An input form with two text fields (for a name and a comment) and a submit button.

## Components and Design

- **Header:** A View containing a Text component with a distinct background color to clearly define the header.
- **Image Display:** An Image component displays a sample image from the internet. The image is styled to maintain its aspect ratio.
- **Scrollable Information:** A ScrollView houses multiple Text components that provide detailed information about the profile.
- **Input Form:** Two TextInput components allow for user interaction. A styled Text component is used to simulate a submit button.

## Challenges and Observations

- **Layout:** Adjusting the styling to ensure that the image doesnâ€™t distort and that the ScrollView shows content correctly required some trial and error.
- **User Input:** Ensuring the TextInput fields are responsive and properly aligned within the form was a useful exercise in layout design.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
